# uae-oil-price-calculator

Description:

Simple webpage to calculate oil price in UAE.

Notice: this project is old (~2015). We wanted to put for anyone interested in using the source code, or integrating the calculator with live prices through APIs.

How to use:

1) Change prices in index.js based on the new ones published by UAE Media
<code>
  // New Rates (August/2015)

    var plusPrice = 2.07;

    var specialPrice = 2.14;

    var superPrice = 2.25;

    var dieselPrice = 2.05;

    // Old Rates (2011 until July/2015)

    var oldPlusPrice = 1.61;

    var oldSpecialPrice = 1.72;

    var oldSuperPrice = 1.83;

    var oldDieselPrice = 2.9;
</code>

2) Open index.html and use the calculator
